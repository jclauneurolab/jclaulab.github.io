                <p>Jonathan Lau is an MD and PhD trained neurosurgeon-researcher in the Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences at Western University with cross-appointments to Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience. He is a certified Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC) and received the Royal College Detweiler traveling scholarship to complete further subspecialty training at Emory University focused on surgical techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders including surgical neuromodulation. He is an early career researcher whose work has been published in NeuroImage, Human Brain Mapping, and Neurosurgery. His research has used advanced imaging techniques to identify small brain structures in vivo, including the elusive zona incerta or "uncertain region" and subfields of the hippocampus, which have important implications as targets for focal surgical therapy. For these projects, he was awarded a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Frederick Banting and Charles Best Doctoral scholarship. His clinical research program is focused on leveraging multimodal datasets (imaging and electrophysiology) with the goal of offering increasingly focal treatment options for patients suffering from neurological disorders, including epilepsy, that maximize benefit while minimizing side effects.</p>
